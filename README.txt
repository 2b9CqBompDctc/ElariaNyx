Digital Art Manifesto

This site serves as a canvas where I, as an artist, seek my path in the world of digital art. My works reflect not only artistic explorations but also deep personal reflections and doubts about the nature of art in the modern technological era.

1. Fusion of Technology and Humanity: I strive to find a balance between the capabilities of artificial intelligence and human imagination, often asking myself - is what I create true art or merely technological manipulation?

2. Ethical Dilemmas: My works spark discussions about authorship and creativity. I often doubt - am I an artist or just a mediator between technology and art?

3. Spiritual and Consciousness Exploration: Through my works, I seek not only artistic but also personal enlightenment, trying to understand my role in this digital creation process.

4. Boundaries of Reality and Fantasy: I create experiences that challenge perception, but I also often find myself on the border between the real and digital worlds.

5. Evolving Narratives: My stories and characters evolve with each viewer, revealing new meanings and interpretations.
